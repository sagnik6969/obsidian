1. test driven development => writing test code for requirement before implementation code
2. First since there is no code the test will fail oviously
3. then we write the code for requirement
4. after that when we run the tests it will pass
5. After that we will refactor the code
6. and the cycle continues with new requirement.

### 2 type of tests
1. unit tests
2. integration tests
