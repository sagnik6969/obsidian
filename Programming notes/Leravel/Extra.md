In PHP, the `static` return type indicates that the method will return an instance of the class on which it is called.
`api` allows different software applications to communicate with eachother.

````php
class TestClass {

    public function fetch(?array $extensions)
    {
        //...
    }        
}
````
=> the above code means that it can either be null or any array.
