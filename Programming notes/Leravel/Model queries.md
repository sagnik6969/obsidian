=> query builder functions require ->`get()` at last 
=> The functions which are not query builders do not require ->`get()`


=> query builder functions start with `where, latest` etc
=> not query builder functions start with `all()` , etc

### TO find a single record
1. `firstWhere()`
2. `find(id)
3. `findOrFail(id)`

=> if you use all() or queries to find a single record => get() is not required 
=> else it is required

=> write `->toSql()`in place of get to get the sql query

=> the above is required for intellisense for eloquent queries


=> The order in which you call the query builder functions does not matter.
=> but it is not always the case if you use order by the first order by takes precedence over 2nd order by.

=> Â **PHP is partially case-sensitive**. PHP constructs, function names, class names are case-insensitive, whereas variables are case-sensitive.

=> `Book::withCount('reviews')->latest()->limit(3)->get();`
The `Book::withCount('reviews')` returns an instance of the query builder for the "Book" model. The `latest()` method is then chained onto this query builder instance to modify the order in which the records are retrieved. This method specifically orders the results based on the created_at column in descending order.

So, in this context, `->latest()` is being called on the query builder instance returned by `Book::withCount('reviews')`.
