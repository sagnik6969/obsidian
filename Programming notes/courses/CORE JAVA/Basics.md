- The main function is the first function called by the runtime system and ultimately your code must be connected to this call in order to be executed by the program.

#### Code
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
```

- The `println` function calls `toString()` function of an object
- `Strings` are immutable in java.
- `s.toUpperCase()`
- `interfaces` forces a class to have certain methods and properties.
- `c instance of Dog` => to check whether object c is instance of class Dog.
- `new Random().nextInt()` => to generate a random integer.
