- the web is made up of 3 programming languages.
#### HTML
- It is a declarative language
- Does not contain any logic / loops
- HTML can render a page even the syntax is wrong in some places.
- When syntax is wrong, The browser guesses what you meant, and does its best to fix the bug itself.

#### CSS
- If something is wrong in CSS. Browser will skip that section and will apply the rest.
- It has a bit more logic than HTML.
#### JavaScript
- it is the most powerful.
- It is also most fragile.
- If something is wrong in the code or the browser is too old to understand the code the browser will stop executing the code.
