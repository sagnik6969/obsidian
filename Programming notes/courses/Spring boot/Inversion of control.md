- spring containers are used to inversion of control.
- Spring container works like an object factory. If we ask spring container for a given object, In the background spring will determine which object to create based on the configuration and create and return the object. It works similar to service container in laravel.
- to configure spring container we use java annotations or java source code.

1. Create and manage objects (Inversion of control).
2. Inject the object dependencies. (Dependency Injection).
