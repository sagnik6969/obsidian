### The problem
1. When running spring boot application
2. If you make changes to your source code
3. Then you have to manually restart your application
### Solution
1. `spring-boot-devtools` => to rescue
2. Automatically restarts your application when code is updated.
3. Simple add the dependency to your pom file.
4. Foe `intellij` we need to setup additional configuration. will discuss shortly.
5. go to `preferences => build, execution, deployment => compiler` 
6. check the box => `build project automatically`
7. go to `preferences => adevanced settings` 
8. check the box => `allow auto-make to start`
9.
