#### To do list
1. Annotate the java class 
2. Develop java code to perform database operations.

- Hibernate is the default JPA implementation of spring boot.
- In the following notes we are going to say `jpa` instead of saying `jpa hibernate`.

#### Terminology
1. Entity class: a java class which is mapped to a database table. (similar to a model class in laravel).
2. Object Relational Mapping (ORM): Mapping a java class to a database table. Similar to laravel.

#### Entity Class:
1. Must be annotated by `@Entity`.
2. Must have a public or protected no argument constructor.
3. The class can have other constructors.
4. If you don't declare a constructor you will get a no argument constructor for free.
5. However If you declare a constructor with arguments you wont get a no argument constructor for free. In this case you have to explicitly declare a no argument constructor. 
#### Java Annotations
1. Step 1: Map class to database table.
2. Step 2: Map fields to database columns.

#### Step 1: Map class to database table
```java
@Entity
@Table(name="student")
public class Student{

}
```
#### Step 2: Map fields to database columns
```java
@Entity
@Table(name="student")
public class Student{
    @Id
    @Column(name='id')
    private int id;
    
    @Column(name='first_name')
    private String firstName;
    
    
}
```

#### `@Column` is optional
- If not specified the column name is same name as java field.
- This approach is not recommended.
- Because if you refactor the java code it will not match existing database column.

#### `@Table` annotation is optional
- If you don't provide the table annotation then database table name is same as java class name.

#### `@Id` annotation
- Specifies the primary key.
- To specify that the id field will be generated by database and managed by the database. `@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)`

#### Bonus points
- You can create your own primary key generation stratagy.
- create implementation of `org.hibernate.id.IdentifierGenerator`
- Override the method `public Serializable generate(...)`
-
