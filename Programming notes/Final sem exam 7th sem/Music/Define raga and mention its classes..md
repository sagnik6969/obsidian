  
A "raga" is a melodic framework used in traditional Indian classical music. It serves as a basis for improvisation and composition. Ragas are characterized by specific ascending and descending patterns of musical notes, known as arohana and avarohana, and may also include certain rules for ornamentation, grace notes, and specific phrases. Each raga is associated with a particular mood, time of day, and season.

There are two main classes of ragas in Indian classical music:

1. **Hindustani Classical Music Ragas:**
    
    - These ragas are primarily associated with North Indian classical music traditions.
    - Some examples include Yaman, Bhairav, Bhimpalasi, Malkauns, and Desi.
2. **Carnatic Classical Music Ragas:**
    
    - These ragas are primarily associated with South Indian classical music traditions.
    - Examples include Shankarabharanam, Kalyani, Todi, Bhairavi, and Kharaharapriya.

Each class has numerous ragas, and each raga has its own distinct characteristics, rules, and emotional nuances. The classification of ragas helps musicians understand and explore the vast and rich tradition of Indian classical music.
