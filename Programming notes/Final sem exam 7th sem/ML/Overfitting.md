### Definition
Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including the noise or random fluctuations in the data, and as a result, it performs poorly on new, unseen data. In other words, the model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize well to new, unseen examples.

### Reasons behind overfitting:
1. **Complex Models :** Models with a high degree of complexity, such as high-order polynomials or models with a large number of parameters, have a greater capacity to fit the training data precisely. While this can be beneficial to capture intricate patterns, it also increases the risk of fitting noise.
2.  **Limited Training Data :**  When the size of the training dataset is small, complex models may find it easier to memorize the data rather than generalize from it. Insufficient data may not adequately represent the underlying patterns in the broader population.
3. **Inclusion of Outliers or Irrelevant Features:** If the training data contains outliers or irrelevant features, the model may learn to fit these anomalies, leading to poor generalization. Noise in the data can mislead the model.
