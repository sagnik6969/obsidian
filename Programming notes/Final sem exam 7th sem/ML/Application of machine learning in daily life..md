### VOICE ASSISTANTS 
Voice assistants like google assistant, Siri, Alexa use AI based algorithms to process our voice commands and generate relevant results.
### FACIAL RECOGNITION 
One of the The most popular application of this AI technology is in the Face ID unlock feature in smartphones today. With time the margin of error in facial recognition gradually decreased. Facial recognition authentication technology used in iPhones are now considered more secure than fingerprints.
### SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS 
AI based recommendation engines track our behavior in social media and based on the behavior it generates personalized feed for us
### PERSONALIZED ADS

### SURVEILLANCE
It is nearly impossible for a human being to keep a constant eye on too many monitors of a CCTV network at the same time. AI is used to automate this process and automatically detect potential threats.
### GOOGLE MAPS 
AI is a critical part of what makes Google Maps so helpful. Google trained its AI using machine learning models on data sets containing information from phones using Google Maps. Then it uses the trained model to determine the best route between two locations.
### SELF-DRIVING CARS 
Artificial intelligence powers self-driving vehicle frameworks. Engineers of selfdriving vehicles utilize immense information from image recognition systems, alongside AI and neural networks, to assemble frameworks that can drive self-sufficiently.
