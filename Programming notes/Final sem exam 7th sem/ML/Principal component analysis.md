1. Used to solve the problem of overfitting.
2. We reduce no of dimensions or features.
3. Reduces the number of features retaining the most of the feature/information

### How PCA Works
1. It combines highly correlated features together to form a new set of features, smaller in size, called ‘Principal components’ that account for data with highest variance.
2. This method of combining features to form a new set of features is called Feature Extraction.
3. Feature extraction is for creating a new, smaller set of features that still captures most  of the useful information.
4. To put all this simply, just think of principal components as new axes that provide the best angle to see and evaluate the data, so that the differences between the  
observations are better visible
