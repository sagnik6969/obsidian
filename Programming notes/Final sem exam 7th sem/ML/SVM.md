- Supervised learning
- Used in classification and regression

## Support Vector Machine Algorithm Explained in Steps:

**1. Data Representation:**

- Each data point is represented as a point in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of features.
- Each feature value corresponds to a specific coordinate.

**2. Choosing the Kernel Function:**

- The kernel function determines how the data is mapped to a higher-dimensional space.
- Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).

**3. Identifying Support Vectors:**

- Support vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane.
- They have a significant impact on the position of the hyperplane and are responsible for its generalization.


**4. Solving the Optimization Problem:**

- The SVM algorithm searches for the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes.The margin refers to the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points on either side, known as support vectors. These support vectors play a critical role in defining the decision boundary for classification.
- This is achieved by solving a mathematical optimization problem.

**5. Making Predictions:**

- New data points are classified by mapping them to the same high-dimensional space and calculating their distance to the hyperplane.
- The point is assigned to the class closest to the hyperplane.

**Additional Steps:**

**- Parameter Tuning:** Tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance for a specific dataset. **- Cross-validation:** Evaluating the performance of the SVM model on unseen data. **- Feature Scaling:** Normalizing features to ensure they have comparable ranges.

**Note:** This is a simplified explanation. The actual implementation of the SVM algorithm involves several mathematical calculations and optimization techniques.
