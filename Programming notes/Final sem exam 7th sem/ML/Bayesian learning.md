1. Bayesian probability talks about partial beliefs.
2. Bayesian estimation calculates the validity of a proposition.
3. It calculates validity based on 1. Prior estimate of its probability and new relevant evidence.

### Base theorem
![[Pasted image 20231206185540.png]]
- P(h/d) => probability of h given d
- p(D / h) => probability of D given h
- p(h) => prior probability
- P(D) => probability of D (new relevant evidence)

### Naive Bayes Classifier
- supervised learning algorithm
- Based on base theorem
- Naive stands for all the variables are independent.
