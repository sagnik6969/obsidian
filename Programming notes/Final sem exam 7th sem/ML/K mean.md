Certainly! The K-Means algorithm is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into K clusters. Here's a step-by-step illustration of how the K-Means algorithm works:

1. **Initialization:**
    
    - Choose the number of clusters, K.
    - Randomly initialize K cluster centroids (points in the feature space).
2. **Assignment:**
    
    - For each data point, calculate the distance to each centroid.
    - Assign the data point to the cluster whose centroid is the closest (usually using Euclidean distance).
3. **Update Centroids:**
    
    - Recalculate the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to that cluster.
4. **Repeat:**
    
    - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, which occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or after a predetermined number of iterations.

The algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids. The steps are as follows:

- **Initialization:**
    
    - Let's say we want to partition data into K=3 clusters. Randomly initialize three centroids: �1,�2,�3C1​,C2​,C3​.
- **Assignment:**
    
    - Calculate the distance of each data point to each centroid and assign it to the cluster with the closest centroid.
    - For example, if �1C1​ is the closest to a data point, it is assigned to Cluster 1.
- **Update Centroids:**
    
    - Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points in each cluster.
    - New �1C1​ becomes the mean of all points assigned to Cluster 1, and similarly for �2C2​ and �3C3​.
- **Repeat:**
    
    - Repeat the Assignment and Update Centroids steps until convergence.

The algorithm converges when the centroids no longer change significantly between iterations. The final result is K clusters, and each data point belongs to the cluster represented by its nearest centroid. K-Means is sensitive to initial centroid placement, so multiple runs with different initializations may be performed to find a more robust solution.
