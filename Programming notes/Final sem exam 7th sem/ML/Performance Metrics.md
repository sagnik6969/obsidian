##  Confusion Matrix

- A table that summarizes the results of a classification model's predictions on a set of test data.
- a 2 X 2 matrix

**What it shows:**

- **True positives (TP):** Correctly predicted as positive.
- **True negatives (TN):** Correctly predicted as negative.
- **False positives (FP):** Incorrectly predicted as positive (also known as Type I error).
- **False negatives (FN):** Incorrectly predicted as negative (also known as Type II error).

**Example:**

### Accuracy

**Formula = `(Tp + Tn) /  (Tp + Tn + Fp + Fn)`**
