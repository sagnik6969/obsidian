Certainly, let's elaborate on each of the points you've listed:

1. **Mendelian Genetics (19th Century):**
   - Gregor Mendel, an Austrian scientist, conducted experiments on pea plants in the mid-19th century.
   - He formulated the laws of inheritance.
   - Mendel's work provided a fundamental understanding of how traits are passed from one generation to the next through discrete units, later known as genes.

2. **Discovery of DNA Structure (1953):**
   - James Watson and Francis Crick, with crucial input from  X-ray crystallography images, proposed the double helical structure of DNA.
   - Their model revealed the complementary base pairing of adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine, explaining the mechanism of DNA replication.

3. **Genetic Code Deciphered (1960s):**
   - In the 1960s, the genetic code, the set of rules by which information encoded in genetic material (DNA or RNA) is translated into proteins, was deciphered.
   - The code revealed the relationship between nucleotide sequences in DNA and the corresponding amino acids in proteins.

4. **Human Genome Project (HGP) Launch (1990):**
   - The HGP was initiated in 1990 as a collaborative international effort involving multiple countries and research institutions.
   - The primary goal was to map and sequence the entire human genome, consisting of approximately 3 billion base pairs.

5. **Completion of HGP (2003):**
   - The Human Genome Project was officially declared complete in 2003.
   - The project not only provided a comprehensive sequence of the human genome but also contributed to the development of new technologies and analytical tools in genomics.
