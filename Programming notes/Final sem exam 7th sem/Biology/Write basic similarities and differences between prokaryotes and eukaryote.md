## Similarities between prokaryotes and eukaryotes

Despite their differences, prokaryotes and eukaryotes also share some key similarities:

- **Both are living organisms:** Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes share the characteristics of life, including the ability to reproduce, grow, respond to stimuli, and maintain homeostasis.
-  **Both use DNA and RNA:** Both types of cells use DNA as their genetic material and RNA to carry out protein synthesis.
- **Both have metabolic processes:** Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes carry out metabolic processes, such as respiration, to convert energy into forms that the cell can use.
- **Both have cell membranes:** Both types of cells have cell membranes that separate the cell's interior from the external environment. These membranes control the movement of substances into and out of the cell.
- **Both have ribosomes:** Ribosomes are the organelles responsible for protein synthesis. They are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
