## Down Syndrome

**Cause:**

Down syndrome occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21. 
**Expression:**

The extra genetic material from chromosome 21 disrupts typical development, leading to a wide range of physical and intellectual features. These can include:
1. distinctive facial features.
2. Delays in reaching developmental milestones like speech, walking, and self-care.
3. Varying degrees of intellectual disability, learning challenges, and attention difficulties.
4. Increased risk of certain health conditions like heart defects, vision problems, and hearing loss.
## Sickle Cell Disease

**Cause:**
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene. 

**Expression:**
The severity of sickle cell disease varies depending on the specific mutations inherited. Common symptoms include:
1. Feeling tired and weak due to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Difficulty breathing due to anemia and blocked blood vessels.
3. In some children, growth and development can be affected.
