Indian classical music and western music differ in several key aspects, including:

**Musical foundation:**

- **Indian:** Melody-based, using **ragas** (melodic frameworks) and **talas** (rhythmic cycles). Improvisation plays a central role.
- **Western:** harmony-based, with multiple melodies interacting and creating chords.

**Instrumentation:**

- **Indian:** Traditionally uses instruments like the sitar, tabla, and tanpura. Emphasis is placed on solo performances and intricate interplay between instruments.
- **Western:** Includes a wide range of instruments, from strings and woodwinds to brass and percussion. Orchestras and ensembles are prominent.

**Purpose and philosophy:**

- **Indian:** Traditionally rooted in spirituality and devotion, with the aim of uplifting the listener's soul.
- **Western:** Can be religious, secular, expressive, or purely aesthetic in its purpose.

**Rhythmic structure:**

- **Indian:** Polyrhythmic, meaning multiple rhythmic patterns can be played simultaneously. 
- **Western:** Monorhythmic.

**Performance style:**

- **Indian:** Typically solo performance. Audience engagement is important.
- **Western:** Often follows a written score and emphasizes technical precision. Audience appreciation is typically expressed after the performance.
