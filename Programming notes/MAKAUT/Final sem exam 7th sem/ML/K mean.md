Certainly! The K-Means algorithm is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into K clusters. Here's a step-by-step illustration of how the K-Means algorithm works:

1. **Initialization:**
    - Choose the number of clusters, K.
    - Randomly initialize K cluster centroids (points in the feature space).
2. **Assignment:**
    - For each data point, calculate the distance to each centroid.
    - Assign the data point to the cluster whose centroid is the closest (usually using Euclidean distance).
3. **Update Centroids:**
    - Recalculate the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to that cluster.
4. **Repeat:**
    - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, which occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or after a predetermined number of iterations.

The algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids. The steps are as follows:

### Example

The algorithm converges when the centroids no longer change significantly between iterations. The final result is K clusters, and each data point belongs to the cluster represented by its nearest centroid. K-Means is sensitive to initial centroid placement, so multiple runs with different initializations may be performed to find a more robust solution.
