- All jobs are stored in `tbljobs`
- `viewjob` => Is  a `sql` `view` => It contains all the tables required in frontend
- `jobs_custom_fields_t` => stores custom fields for jobs
- `job_secondery_contacts` => we store relation between job and contacts.
- `jobs.json` => works similar to `candidates.json`. stores all default settings related to jobs table. 
- When used changes the default settings in the jobs table the new settings gets saved in `tbl_datatable_settings` 
- `$router->post('/search/get', 'JobController@search');` => fetches the jobs table according to the table settings.
- similar to `candidate` in `entityColumns.php` we have a case for jobs also. If the user updates default table settings it will get stored in the database. In `entityColumns.php` we first fetch `jobs.json` the we try to fetch the settings from database which user has updated.
