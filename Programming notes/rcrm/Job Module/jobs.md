In recruit crm we have above 4 type of roles.

- We can change different settings in job application form in admin settings.
- `default job application form visibility`. If checked candidates can apply to the job from outside.
- `post on job boards.` => when a new job is added it will get automatically get posted in free job boards. 
### Assigned candidates.
- `All candidates` => All candidates which are assigned to a job. 
- `visibility` => if the candidate is visible to the contact associated with the job.
- `field shared with clients` => the columns which are shared with the clients.
- In admin settings we can set global visibility for the columns.
- `submit candidates` => we can either submit a list of candidates or we can submit a link by clicking which contacts can view the candidate list.
- by clicking the link clients can view the candidate and also edit the candidate status and submit client feedback.
- users can view client feedback in client feedback page.
- `related deals` => If someone adds the job to any deal the the deal will be shown in related deal section.
